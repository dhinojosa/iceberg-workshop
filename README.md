[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/dhinojosa/iceberg-workshop?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=748638957&machine=standardLinux32gb)

## Introduction

1. What do you do? Where do you work? What city are you in?
2. What is your experience with SQL?
3. What storage is currently at your workplace?
4. What do you do for Zen?

## ðŸ’¡ Using Codespaces for This Workshop

We recommend GitHub Codespaces (4-core, 16 GB) to run Kafka, Java, and Docker together. This is already configured for you.

**You do NOT need a credit card**.

The workshop runs ~8 hours, which uses about **32 core-hours**.
GitHub Free users get **120 core-hours per month**, so youâ€™re good **unless youâ€™ve used Codespaces earlier this month**.

## Before the workshop

Visit [https://github.com/settings/billing](https://github.com/settings/billing) to confirm you have enough core-hours.

If you run out midway, weâ€™ll help you pair up or add you to a backup workspace or I can add you to my organization.


## During Breaks

It is important that during breaks and lunch that you *Stop* your GitHub Workspace so that you don't lose any core hours
